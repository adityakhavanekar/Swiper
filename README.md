# Swipe Mart (Swipe Assignment)

## Introduction
This iOS app is designed for the Swipe assignment, aiming to provide users with access to product data available through the Swipe API. Users can efficiently search through the product list and also have the option to add their own products using a simple form. The app is built upon the MVVM architecture and employs the SDWebImage pod for effective image caching, as well as Alamofire for RESTful API communication.


## Running the App
To get started, follow these steps:

1) Open the terminal and navigate to the project folder.
2) Enter the command 'pod install' in the terminal and press enter.
3) Once the pods are installed, close the terminal and open the 'Swiper.xcworkspace' file.
4) Allow some time for the workspace to resolve all packages.
5) Choose a simulator or a connected device (if using a real device, ensure you've added your development team in the project navigator).
